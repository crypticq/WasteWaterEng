# Coagulation 
Following screening and other pre-treatment processes, the next unit process in a conventional water treatment plant is mixing. The term coagulation refers to the series of chemical and mechanical operations by which coagulants are applied and made effective. These operations include two distinct phases: (1) rapid mising to disperse coagulant chemicals by violet agitation into the water being treated, and (2) flocculation to agglomerate small particles into well-defined floc by gentle agitation for a much longer time. The coagulant must be added to the raw water and perfectly distributed into the liquid. Coagulation results from adding salts of iron or aluminum, involves adding coagulants with a positive charge to water to neutralize the negative charge of suspended particles, colloids, or oily materials.  to the water and is a reaction between one of the following coagulants and water

## factors affect The  coagulation

1. pH or Raw Water
2. Raw Water Temperature
3. Mixing


Types Of Cogulants

1. Alum(AL(SO4)3 = 18H2O)
2. Sodium aluminate(NaAlO₂)
3. Ferric sulfate(Fe2(SO4)3)
4. Ferrous sulfate(FeSO₄)
5. Ferric chloride(FeCl3)
6. Polymers(linear, cross-linked, and structural)


Method s of mmixing Alum with Raw Water.

1. Dry Feeding
	1. Use Alum as a powder 
2. Wet feeding 
	1. Use the alum in liquid form
	2. Better than fry feeding 
	3. Need concenrated alum solution tank
	4. 10% the concentrtion of alum
	5. Num of tanks = 3 ?(8 Hrs Period / tanks)








## **Summary**

Following screening and other pre-treatment processes, the next unit process in a conventional water treatment plant is mixing, when chemicals are added during the coagulation process. Flocculation follows coagulation in the conventional system and is the physical process of slowly mixing the coagulated water to increase the probability of particle collision. to improves the sedimentation process, which results in longer filter runs and higher quality finished water. Because coagulation reactions occur very quickly, detention time for flash mixers is measured in seconds, whereas the detention time for flocculation basins takes more time and is generally between 5 and 30 minutes. When adding chemicals to the water flow (known as dosing), a measured amount of chemical is required which is dependent upon such factors as the type of chemical used, the reason for dosing, and the flow rate being treated. This is important for forecasting expected chemical use by comparing it with chemicals in inventory and determine when additional chemicals will be required
